# My Transitions iOS
## Technical Documentation



### GETTING STARTED
myTransitions iOS requires Xcode 11.0 and above for development. This project uses Swift 5 as the Programming Language, Storyboard for the Interface and CocoaPods for Third Party Libraries. The app also uses CoreData to store offline information. The current Xcode version used for development is 11.5. The minimum iOS Version required is iOS 11.0


### INSTALLATION AND DEVELOPMENT
In order to start with the development, first, you will need an Apple account for development. It must be under the team **Rogomi, Inc.** Then, open the **myTransitions.xcworkspace** under the repository root directory. If possible, do a **pods repo update** in order to avoid missing library errors.


### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 
myTransitions iOS uses the latest Swift version, Swift 5, for development.


### MINIMUM VERSION 
myTransitions iOS requires devices with at least iOS 12.0


### APPLICATION ID
dev.transitions.iris.app


### DEBUGGING
We use a few debugging tools to test myTransitionâ€™s functionalities.  

For the Native App, we use Xcode's debugging console to create breakpoints and test variables, API responses, and identify null objects which sometimes causes the crash.

To test the API before integrating for app usage, we use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). Postman is a very reliable REST API tool. We can test different HTTP Methods especially POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE and GET. We can also add header variables to test SSO and token authentications.

We also use iOS Simulator in order to test the apps in different screen sizes and iOS Versions.


### WEB API
Google Sign In API, Azure
